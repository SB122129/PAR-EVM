## portal-rest (SDK Daemon)

### Unreleased

---

### [0.3.0] - 2026-02-26

#### Changed
- `RequestInvoice` command now uses slim `RequestInvoiceParams`: `current_exchange_rate` removed (server computes it); `request_id` is now optional (defaults to command ID if omitted)
- SDK versions (portal-sdk npm, portal-java-sdk) are now aligned with portal-rest version for easy compatibility tracking

#### Fixed
- Validate `RequestInvoice` response: invoice amount must match expected amount (computed from FIAT conversion). Allows 1 msat tolerance for rounding errors (#157)

---

### [0.2.0] - 2026-02-17

#### Added
- `PayInvoice` command
- `GetWalletInfo` command
- `RequestSinglePayment` accepts an optional `request_id` parameter

#### Changed
- Default Breez storage directory changed to `~/.portal-rest/breez`
- Removed unused dependencies (`dotenv`, `bitflags`, `android_logger`, `async`); workspace deps centralized and reorganized
- Updated Breez SDK

#### Fixed
- Cargo warnings cleanup
